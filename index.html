                    <p>Some may know me as Tom others my know me as NewDawn0, which is the name under which I publish my projects online.
                      Although I have only started learning to code 1.5 years ago, I already know many different programming languages.
                      The one which I currently use the most frequently is the Bash scripting language. In the past few months I made several projects using Bash, one of which was a
                      multi-threaded, multi-platform package manager named after my cat Shin. Another project I recently made as a school project was a Connect 4 website, using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
                      During this project I learnt the basics of frontend and backend web development. Other languages I know are Python, C and a little bit of RISC-V Assembly.

                    </br>
                    <p>Aside of the programming languages, I have experience in different operating systems, like Mac OS, Linux and Windows.
                    Mostly because I used them all. I originally started with Windows, later I moved to Mac OS which is where I discovered
                    my love for UNIX based systems.
                    About 9 months ago, I tried Raspian, which is a Linux based operating system. I was very happy with it, so I decided
                    to try out other Linux distributions like Debian, Ubuntu, Kali, ArchLabs and finally Arch Linux which is the one I'm
                    currently using.</p>

                                In february of 2021 I was introduced to the terminal by a friend. When he showed me some commands I was absolutely stunned which is why I decided to learn how to use the terminal and the bash scripting language. Whilst learning bash I found out about Git and GitHub so I figured it wouldn't hurt to learn how to use the git version control system.
                                Now that I know how to use the terminal and bash I'm really enjoying it. I usually do most tasks on the terminal for times sake.

                                Since then I've picked up some other skills like using Sass and Node JS.

                              Shin is a package manager written in bash, it is the one that I currently use to manage my software. I created the Shin package manager because I have about 6 or 7 package managers installed on my mac and I'm never quite sure wich one to use.
                              Shin combines all these package managers into one. Meaning you just have to remember one command to install a package and Shin will automatically handle which one to install it with.
                              During development time I learnt a lot more about bash scripting and how to use it. I recently added a multi-threading option to the config file.

                              "Create templates" is a replacement for the touch command. When you make a new file using Create you automatically get some well structured code template in the file if the filetype is supported.
                              My motivation for coding Create was to have an automatically generated template, which forces me to better structurize my code.
